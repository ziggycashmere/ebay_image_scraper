The eBay Image Downloader / Scraper is a program for downloading all of the images from a single eBay listing into one place as a batch process. The program will create a new folder for each listing to contain the images.

This program can be used in two ways. A link to a single listing can be given to download the images only from that listing or a text file with a single link on each line can be given so each listing contained will be scraped.

The GUI release is self-explanatory.

To use the console release (ebaydl) the usage is
  <b> python ebaydl.py (url or txt) (download directory) </b>
